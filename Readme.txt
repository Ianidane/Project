Similar to the life simulator that's 1 day turn based.

You are a soldier in a certain war or series of wars. Live life day by day via one button but you can influence
certain events in between days and such depending on rank.

You have an inventory and get paid a wage by your captain or leige.

Thinking it will have basically the same interface as the life simulator with a couple other sub windows.

battles would be eu4 style where there are 3 flanks and it's units going into battle with you bein one of them
you watch the battle unfold but no indepth graphics or anything, just the battle system like eu4 where you
watch each flank attack each other.


think life simulator graphics/engine, mount and blade freedom, eu4 battles



All open to interpretation or change.

I read up on it and it's definately doable in python which is the language I know the most right now.



For events, blit one image to the screen and then blit another image on top of that image for the button and
blit the text to the first image


Spare time activities - choose one spare time activity while on the ship to influence future events
